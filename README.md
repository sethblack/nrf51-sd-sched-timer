# nrf51-sd-sched-timer
Nordic's examples are a bit verbose, so I created a quick soft device scheduler-based timer that works on both the NRF51822 as well as the NRF51422.

# Requirements

CrossStudio for ARM 3.4 (it will compile on the free version)
Nordic NRF51 SDK (http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF51_SDK/nRF51_SDK_v8.x.x/) installed up one directory in a directory called Nordic (i.e. ../Nordic/nRF51_SDK_v8.0.0/)
